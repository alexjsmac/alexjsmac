I'm currently working on building audiovisual analysis tools for the broadcast industry and learning lots of Rust with [evertz.io](https://evertz.io/).

When I'm not doing that I'm working on a new media art pracice. You can check out some finished projects [here](http://www.alexmaclean.ca/portfolio/).
